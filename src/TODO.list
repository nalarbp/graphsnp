//SOME RULE & NAMING CONVENTION
1. File: camelCase separated by underscore
2. Style: lowercase separated by hyphen
3. Constants: MODULE_DESCRIPTION
4. x means done. - means to do list


//TO DO LIST
# Input loading
x separate or all in one? separate is fine, if the tool works, user wont bother to load 1 or 2 more times
x sequence input, and directly create hamming matrix, OK
x metadata input OK 

#DATA-MODEL 
##Hamming-Matrix 
    - Adjacency list full matrix implemented in Map Object: {v1:[{target: tv, value: pwv}, ...], v2: [{},..]}
    - .getSymetricEdges => return a symetric matrix in Map Object 
    - What do you need from a matrix: need a nodeList, full_edgeList, upper_edgeList, lower_edgeList, cutOff_edgeList

## Graph-Object 
    - A plain object consist of keys: creator, nodes, edges: {}
    - Should change to prototype model 

## Cluster-Object

#ALGORITHM 

#PAGE-SNP-DIST 
x intra and inter genetic diversity

#PAGE-GRAPH-SNP 
x need to be able to save the reconstructed graph, so no wasting time to repeat reconstruction
x add example case dataset
x add option for cluster or transmission network reconstruction

x Fix buh in Spread algorithm 
x Add update layout next to layout option: user need to click the update button to update the layout
- Add color legend below the selected data info box
- Add legend about nodes, edges, edge label, selected node
x always use current color when draw the graph


# Graph drawing
## Create HammingMatrixMap 
    x get HammingMatrixMap from STORE, 
    x If NONE: create one, save to STORE
    x Hamming comparion only done once but save in both direction (making a symetric matrix), save in AdjMap format

## Create GraphMap based on user's construction method
    - Get the construction method
    - Call create graph object (in: HammingMatrixMap, out: GraphMap)
    - Save GraphMap STORE => for CLUSTERING purpose 
    - include method attributes, if current method != with storeMethod, create new, otherwise take from store: WONT work you need to check cutoff as well: SKIP

## View in Cytoscape
    x Always create a new CytoscapeData from a fresh GraphObjectMap. PERIOD
    x Load, view, save to current state


## Metadata group
    x hash map on each metadata header based on their categorical group

x Tidy up the architecture (before its too big and messy)

x Home: all initial states 

x filter final_snpDist so no duplicated edges (MEG)
x Create loading mechanism on graph container
x Add refresh/ re-draw button
x Add filter edges algorithm 

## CGE algorithm
    - create non-duplicated edgeList from HammingMatrix (use deep clone and values())
    - create hash map on each metadata header based on their categorical group, blank is NA
    - Iterate all edge in edgeList:
        - change value to base = 0 
        - look up edge cutoff, if below, add value with 1
        - look up (iterate) all available hash map key, if edge in the list (indexOf), add value with 1

## STATE RESET 
x export a list of object containing all state and respective action 
x loop through all states, and set it all to the initial state
x we need to make a separate elements/module for reloading dataset       

## BUGS
x when draw charts, even its on all-samples, group also re-drawn.
x demo interfacility, crash
