//TO DO LIST
# Input loading
- separate or all in one? separate is fine, if the tool works, user wont bother to load 1 or 2 more times
- sequence input OK
- metadata input OK 
- tree input, not yet

# Graph drawing
## Create HammingMatrixMap 
    - get HammingMatrixMap from STORE
    - If NONE: create one, save to STORE
    - Hamming comparion only done once but save in both direction (making a symetric matrix), save in AdjMap format

## Create GraphMap based on user's construction method
    - Get the construction method
    - Call create graph object (in: HammingMatrixMap, out: GraphMap)
    - Save GraphMap STORE => for CLUSTERING purpose 
    - include method attributes, if current method != with storeMethod, create new, otherwise take from store: WONT work you need to check cutoff as well: SKIP

## View in Cytoscape
    - Always create a new CytoscapeData from a fresh GraphObjectMap. PERIOD
    - Load, view, save to current state


- Tidy up the architecture (before its too big and messy)

- Home: all initial states 

x filter final_snpDist so no duplicated edges (MEG)
x Create loading mechanism on graph container
x Add refresh/ re-draw button
x Add filter edges algorithm
